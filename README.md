## üß† Features Used for Prediction

| Feature                | Type         | Example Values                             |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Event_Type`           | Categorical  | Competition, Lecture, Seminar, Workshop    |
| `Venue`                | Categorical  | Auditorium, Hall, Online, Ground           |
| `Target_Audience`      | Categorical  | Faculty, General Public, Students          |
| `Weather_Condition`    | Categorical  | Clear, Rainy, Stormy                       |
| `Social_Media_Activity`| Numerical    | e.g. 2384, 1456                             |

These features are internally encoded before being passed to the trained model.
